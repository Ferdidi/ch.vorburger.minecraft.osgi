# ch.vorburger.minecraft.osgi

This is a [spongepowered.org](https://www.spongepowered.org/) Minecraft Server plugin which embeds an OSGi Framework ([Apache Felix](http://felix.apache.org/)).

This Minecraft plugin can then (dynamically, HOT, re-*) load OSGi bundles as additional Minecraft plugins.

[Watch this early POC video on YouTube demonstrating live Minecraft mod development](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mibW8MhenGc), and see the [vorburger/HoTea project](https://github.com/vorburger/HoTea) for an earlier pre-OSGi take on (and superseded by) this.  Also check out the [ch.vorburger.osgi.gradle companion project](https://github.com/vorburger/ch.vorburger.osgi.gradle).
